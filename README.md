# Simple Maze Generator
  
Simple maze generator, written in python3 using pillow as the only dependancy. Creates mazes using random walk, and can save them as images.
If you'd like to change the appearance of the maze, changing these will produce different results:
  
create_background  
size  
cell_size  

# Prerequisites
PIL - https://pypi.org/project/pillow/
